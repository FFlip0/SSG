# Fundamental IT Skills
## Computer Hardware Components
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**: Executes most instructions, "the brain."
- **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: Temporary memory that stores data for active processes, different from HDD/SSD due to speed.
- **HDD/SSD**: The main storage hard drive of the device, different from RAM due to being long-term and slower.
- **Motherboard**: The main (mother) of the computer that brings together a lot of the components onto one circuit board to be connected.
- **PSU (Power Supply Unit)**: Converts electricity into the power of the computer.
- **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)**: Essentially a CPU made for graphics rendering and now-a-days AI.
- **Cooling Systems**: Fan or liquid cooling for not overheating other components.
- **Input/Output keyboards**: Keyboards, Microphones and Headphones are examples of input/output devices, input (microphone) meaning giving data to the device and output (headphones) meaning getting data from the device.

## Connection Types and their function 

- **Ethernet (Networking)**
	- A wired network connection
	- Reliable and extremely fast 
	- Often used in offices .
- **Wi-Fi (Networking)**
	- A wireless network connection
	- Flexible and for mobile
	- Can have "interference" issues from access point
	- Often used in homes or public spaces
- **Bluetooth (Connecting Devices)**
	- Used for connecting devices in a short range. (Typically 10m range)
	- Often used by normal consumers
	- e.g. Headphones, keyboards and other devices
- **Fiber-optic Connections**
	- Ultra-fast wires for long distance connections (but their expensive)
	- Often used by underwater network cables and data centers.
- **Cellular Connections**
	-
